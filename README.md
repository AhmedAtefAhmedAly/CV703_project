# Perception for pin-picking

Multi-modal 6DoF pose estimation for industrial bin-picking using RGB, depth, and polarization with SAM-6D and SimplePoseNet

## Overview

This project tackles the challenge of accurate 6-DoF object pose estimation in cluttered industrial bin-picking scenarios using a multi-camera setup. It reproduces and extends two baseline methodsâ€”SimplePoseNet and SAM-6Dâ€”by incorporating:

- Depth fusion into SimplePoseNet for enhanced robustness.
- A DoLP-based image preprocessing pipeline to improve segmentation quality in SAM-6D.
- A multi-view spatial fusion step to improve pose accuracy and reduce false positives.
